- Scenario 1: The userâ€™ s hands are occupied with other tasks and he/she intends to zoom the screen using gestures.
(i.e., cooking from a written recipe)

Solution: The user applies wrist rotation gesture to zoom
in the screen.

- Scenario 2: The user is sitting in front of his/her laptop
without noticing his/her bad posture (too close to the
screen).

Solution: The system detect the lean-in posture and zoom in the screen to force the user back to origin.

Also, we might have several small activities in front of the laptop like, 

- Typing on the keyboard or not moving
- Moving items (i.e., grab a coffee cup and drink, switch the placement of your notebook to somewhere else.)
